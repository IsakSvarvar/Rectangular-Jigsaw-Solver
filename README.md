# Rectangular-Jigsaw-Solver
Python notebook featuring a rectangular jigsaw problem and a simulated annealing solver. This notebook was created for an assignment in an optimization course and showcases the implementation of a metaheuristic optimization solver.

The code takes parameters K, Q for box dimensions and an array of rectangles containing their sizes.
The rectangles then need to be arranged within the dimensions of the box (as well as possible).
